==4625== TO CONTROL THIS PROCESS USING vgdb (which you probably

==4625== 
==4625== TO DEBUG THIS PROCESS USING GDB: start GDB like this
==4625==   /path/to/gdb ./project
==4625== and then give GDB the following command
==4625==   target remote | /usr/lib/valgrind/../../bin/vgdb --pid=4625
==4625== --pid is optional if only one valgrind process is running
